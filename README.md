You can learn, share and practice a variety of wonderful recipes with other food lovers.

CookBook is a platform to learn and practice cooking, as well as recipes sharing.
You can create your own cookbook, or learn from others’ sharing recipes to practice a variety of exciting dishes.
If you wish, you can also invite platform users to make dishes with the same theme of recipe, and share the results with other more users for learning.
